This is a companion project to Computer Check-in System (Technician). This project allows for customers how have checked in a computer using the
Computer Check-in System to be able to look up the status of their computer and leave notes for the tech(s) working on the computer. To use this
you will need to install the Computer Check-in System (Technician) project as well (https://github.com/mwalles2/Computer-Check-in-System--Technician-).

CONFIG FILE
The two files that need to set up are:

{WEBSERVERROOT}/includes/php/db.php
{WEBSERVERROOT}/includes/php/ldap_info.php

There are examples of these files in the includes directory.

UNL SPECIFIC FILES
There are design files that are specific to UNL (http://www.unl.edu) and the UNL Computer Help Center (http://ischc.unl.edu).  This was a temporary
measure for expedience.  These files will be removed in the future once a system as been built to allow easier customization.
